DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A command object is usually created by calling 'Connection::createCommand()'.
 The SQL statement it represents can be set via the 'sql' property.

 To execute a non-query SQL (such as INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE), call
 'execute()'. To execute a SQL statement that returns a result data set (such
 as SELECT), use 'queryAll()', 'queryOne()', 'queryColumn()', 'queryScalar()',
 or 'query()'.

 For example,

   $users = $connection->createCommand('SELECT * FROM user')->queryAll();

 Command supports SQL statement preparation and parameter binding. Call
 'bindValue()' to bind a value to a SQL parameter; Call 'bindParam()' to bind
 a PHP variable to a SQL parameter. When binding a parameter, the SQL
 statement is automatically prepared. You may also call 'prepare()' explicitly
 to prepare a SQL statement.

 Command also supports building SQL statements by providing methods such as
 'insert()', 'update()', etc. For example, the following code will create and
 execute an INSERT SQL statement:

   $connection->createCommand()->insert('user', [
       'name' => 'Sam',
       'age' => 30,
   ])->execute();

 To build SELECT SQL statements, please use 'Query' instead.

 For more details and usage information on Command, see the [guide article on
 Database Access Objects](guide:db-dao).

<
return ($this) The command object itself

 Enables query cache for this command.

    [$duration] (int) The number of seconds that query result of this command
    can remain valid in the cache. If this is not set, the value of
    'Connection::queryCacheDuration' will be used instead. Use 0 to indicate
    that the cached data will never expire.

    with the cached query result.


*yii/db/Command::noCache*					public
>
 noCache()
<
return ($this) The command object itself

 Disables query cache for this command.


*yii/db/Command::getSql*					public
>
 getSql()
<
return (string) The SQL statement to be executed

 Returns the SQL statement for this command.


*yii/db/Command::setSql*					public
>
 setSql($sql)
<
return ($this) This command instance

 Specifies the SQL statement to be executed. The SQL statement will be quoted
 using 'Connection::quoteSql()'.

 The previous SQL (if any) will be discarded, and 'params' will be cleared as
 well. See 'reset()' for details.

    [$sql] (string) The SQL statement to be set.


*yii/db/Command::setRawSql*				public
>
 setRawSql($sql)
<
return ($this) This command instance

 Specifies the SQL statement to be executed. The SQL statement will not be
 modified in any way.

 The previous SQL (if any) will be discarded, and 'params' will be cleared as
 well. See 'reset()' for details.

    [$sql] (string) The SQL statement to be set.


*yii/db/Command::getRawSql*				public
>
 getRawSql()
<
return (string) The raw SQL with parameter values inserted into the corresponding
placeholders in 'sql'.

 Returns the raw SQL by inserting parameter values into the corresponding
 placeholders in 'sql'.

 Note that the return value of this method should mainly be used for logging
 purpose. It is likely that this method returns an invalid SQL due to improper
 replacement of parameter placeholders.


*yii/db/Command::prepare*					public
>
 prepare($forRead='null')
<
return (void)

 Prepares the SQL statement to be executed.

 For complex SQL statement that is to be executed multiple times, this may
 improve performance. For SQL statement with binding parameters, this method
 is invoked automatically.

    [$forRead] (bool) Whether this method is called for a read query. If null,
    it means the SQL statement should be used to determine whether it is for
    read or write.


*yii/db/Command::cancel*					public
>
 cancel()
<
return (void)

 Cancels the execution of the SQL statement.

 This method mainly sets 'pdoStatement' to be null.


*yii/db/Command::bindParam*				public
>
 bindParam($name, $value, $dataType=null, $length=null, $driverOptions='null')
<
return ($this) The current command being executed

 Binds a parameter to the SQL statement to be executed.

    [$name] (string|int) Parameter identifier. For a prepared statement using
    named placeholders, this will be a parameter name of the form ':name'. For
    a prepared statement using question mark placeholders, this will be the
    1-indexed position of the parameter.
    [$value] (mixed) The PHP variable to bind to the SQL statement parameter
    (passed by reference)
    [$dataType] (int) SQL data type of the parameter. If null, the type is
    determined by the PHP type of the value.
    [$length] (int) Length of the data type
    [$driverOptions] (mixed) The driver-specific options


*yii/db/Command::bindPendingParams*			protected
>
 bindPendingParams()
<
return (void)

 Binds pending parameters that were registered via 'bindValue()' and
 'bindValues()'.

 Note that this method requires an active 'pdoStatement'.

>
 bindValue($name, $value, $dataType=null)
<
return ($this) The current command being executed

 Binds a value to a parameter.

    [$name] (string|int) Parameter identifier. For a prepared statement using
    named placeholders, this will be a parameter name of the form ':name'. For
    a prepared statement using question mark placeholders, this will be the
    1-indexed position of the parameter.
    [$value] (mixed) The value to bind to the parameter
    [$dataType] (int) SQL data type of the parameter. If null, the type is
    determined by the PHP type of the value.


*yii/db/Command::bindValues*				public
>
 bindValues($values)
<
return ($this) The current command being executed

 Binds a list of values to the corresponding parameters.

 This is similar to 'bindValue()' except that it binds multiple values at a
 time. Note that the SQL data type of each value is determined by its PHP
 type.

    [$values] (array) The values to be bound. This must be given in terms of
    an associative array with array keys being the parameter names, and array
    values the corresponding parameter values, e.g. '[':name' => 'John',
    ':age' => 25]'. By default, the PDO type of each value is determined by
    its PHP type. You may explicitly specify the PDO type by using an array:
    '[value, type]', e.g. '[':name' => 'John', ':profile' => [$profile,
    \PDO::PARAM_LOB''.


*yii/db/Command::query*					public
>
 query()
<
return (\yii\db\DataReader) The reader object for fetching the query result

>
 queryOne($fetchMode=null)
<
return (array|false) The first row (in terms of an array) of the query result. False
is returned if the query results in nothing.

 Executes the SQL statement and returns the first row of the result.

 This method is best used when only the first row of result is needed for a
 query.

    [$fetchMode] (int) The result fetch mode. Please refer to [PHP
    manual](http://php.net/manual/en/pdostatement.setfetchmode.php) for valid
    fetch modes. If this parameter is null, the value set in 'fetchMode' will
    be used.


*yii/db/Command::queryScalar*				public
>
 queryScalar()
<
return (string|null|false) The value of the first column in the first row of the
query result. False is returned if there is no value.

 first row of data.

 This method is best used when only a single value is needed for a query.

 queryColumn()
<
return (array) The first column of the query result. Empty array is returned if the
query results in nothing.

 Executes the SQL statement and returns the first column of the result.

    [$columns] (array|\yii\db\Query) The column data (name => value) to be
    inserted into the table or instance of 'yii\db\Query|Query' to perform

       ['Linda', 25],
   ])->execute();

 inserted.

 Note that the values in each row must match the corresponding column names.

 Also note that the created command is not executed until 'execute()' is
 called.

    [$table] (string) The table that new rows will be inserted into.
    [$columns] (array) The column names

   $minAge = 30;
   $connection->createCommand()->update('user', ['status' => 1], 'age >
 :minAge', [':minAge' => $minAge])->execute();
