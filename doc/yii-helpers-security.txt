======================

 In particular, Security supports the following features:

 - Encryption/decryption: [[encrypt()]] and [[decrypt()]] - Data tampering
 prevention: [[hashData()]] and [[validateData()]] - Password validation:
 [[generatePasswordHash()]] and [[validatePassword()]]

 Additionally, Security provides [[getSecretKey()]] to support generating
 named secret keys. These secret keys, once generated, will be stored in a
 file and made available in future requests.
