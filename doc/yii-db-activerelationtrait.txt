*yii/db/ActiveRelationTrait*  
============================


PROPERTY DETAILS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$multiple				*yii/db/ActiveRelationTrait::$multiple*

 (bool) Whether this query represents a relation to more than one record. This
 property is only used in relational context. If true, this relation will
 populate all query results into AR instances using 'Query::all()|all()'. If
 false, only the first row of the results will be retrieved using
 'Query::one()|one()'.

$primaryModel				*yii/db/ActiveRelationTrait::$primaryModel*

 (\yii\db\ActiveRecord) The primary model of a relational query. This is used
 only in lazy loading with dynamic query options.

$link					*yii/db/ActiveRelationTrait::$link*

 (array) The columns of the primary and foreign tables that establish a
 relation. The array keys must be columns of the table for this relation, and
 the array values must be the corresponding columns from the primary table. Do
 not prefix or quote the column names as this will be done automatically by
 Yii. This property is only used in relational context.

$via					*yii/db/ActiveRelationTrait::$via*

 (array|object) The query associated with the junction table. Please call
 'via()' to set this property instead of directly setting it. This property is
 only used in relational context.

$inverseOf				*yii/db/ActiveRelationTrait::$inverseOf*

 (string) The name of the relation that is the inverse of this relation. For
 example, an order has a customer, which means the inverse of the "customer"
 relation is the "orders", and the inverse of the "orders" relation is the
 "customer". If this property is set, the primary record(s) will be referenced
 through the specified relation. For example, '$customer->orders[0]->customer'
 and '$customer' will be the same object, and accessing the customer of an
 order will not trigger new DB query. This property is only used in relational
 context.



METHOD DETAILS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*yii/db/ActiveRelationTrait::__clone*			public
>
 __clone()
<
return (void)



*yii/db/ActiveRelationTrait::via*				public
>
 via($relationName, $callable='null')
<
return ($this) The relation object itself.

 Use this method to specify a pivot record/table when declaring a relation in
 the 'ActiveRecord' class:

   class Order extends ActiveRecord
   {
      public function getOrderItems() {
          return $this->hasMany(OrderItem::className(), ['order_id' => 'id']);
      }

      public function getItems() {
          return $this->hasMany(Item::className(), ['id' => 'item_id'])
                      ->via('orderItems');
      }
   }



    [$relationName] (string) The relation name. This refers to a relation
    declared in 'primaryModel'.
    [$callable] (callable) A PHP callback for customizing the relation
    associated with the junction table. Its signature should be
    'function($query)', where '$query' is the query to be customized.


*yii/db/ActiveRelationTrait::inverseOf*			public
>
 inverseOf($relationName)
<
return ($this) The relation object itself.

 For example, an order has a customer, which means the inverse of the
 "customer" relation is the "orders", and the inverse of the "orders" relation
 is the "customer". If this property is set, the primary record(s) will be
 referenced through the specified relation. For example,
 '$customer->orders[0]->customer' and '$customer' will be the same object, and
 accessing the customer of an order will not trigger a new DB query.

 Use this method when declaring a relation in the 'ActiveRecord' class:

   public function getOrders()
   {
       return $this->hasMany(Order::className(), ['customer_id' =>
 'id'])->inverseOf('customer');
   }



    [$relationName] (string) The name of the relation that is the inverse of
    this relation.


*yii/db/ActiveRelationTrait::findFor*			public
>
 findFor($name, $model)
<
return (mixed) The related record(s)

 This method is invoked when a relation of an ActiveRecord is being accessed
 in a lazy fashion.

    [$name] (string) The relation name
    [$model] (\yii\db\ActiveRecordInterface|\yii\db\BaseActiveRecord) The
    primary model


*yii/db/ActiveRelationTrait::populateRelation*		public
>
 populateRelation($name, $primaryModels)
<
return (array) The related models

    [$name] (string) The relation name
    [$primaryModels] (array) Primary models
