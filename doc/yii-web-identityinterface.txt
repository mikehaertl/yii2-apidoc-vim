*yii/web/IdentityInterface*  
===========================

DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This interface can typically be implemented by a user model class. For
 example, the following code shows how to implement this interface by a User
 ActiveRecord class:

   // find customers together with their orders and country
   Customer::find()->with('orders', 'country')->all();
   // find customers together with their orders and the orders' shipping
 address
   Customer::find()->with('orders.address')->all();
   // find customers together with their country and orders of status 1
   Customer::find()->with([
       'orders' => function ($query) {
           $query->andWhere('status = 1');
       },
       'country',
   ])->all();





METHOD DETAILS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*yii/web/IdentityInterface::findIdentity*			public
>
 findIdentity($id)
<
(\yii\web\IdentityInterface) The identity object that matches the given ID.
Null should be returned if such an identity cannot be found or the identity is
not in an active state (disabled, deleted, etc.)

    [$id] (string|integer) The ID to be looked for


*yii/web/IdentityInterface::findIdentityByAccessToken*	public
>
 findIdentityByAccessToken($token, $type='null')
<
(\yii\web\IdentityInterface) The identity object that matches the given token.
Null should be returned if such an identity cannot be found or the identity is
not in an active state (disabled, deleted, etc.)

    [$token] (mixed) The token to be looked for
    [$type] (mixed) The type of the token. The value of this parameter depends
    on the implementation. For example, '\yii\filters\auth\HttpBearerAuth'
    will set this parameter to be 'yii\filters\auth\HttpBearerAuth'.


*yii/web/IdentityInterface::getId*			public
>
 getId()
<
(string|integer) An ID that uniquely identifies a user identity.



*yii/web/IdentityInterface::getAuthKey*			public
>
 getAuthKey()
<
(string) A key that is used to check the validity of a given identity ID.

 The key should be unique for each individual user, and should be persistent
 so that it can be used to check the validity of the user identity.

 The space of such keys should be big enough to defeat potential identity
 attacks.

 This is required if 'User::enableAutoLogin' is enabled.


*yii/web/IdentityInterface::validateAuthKey*		public
>
 validateAuthKey($authKey)
<
(boolean) Whether the given auth key is valid.

 This is required if 'User::enableAutoLogin' is enabled.
    [$authKey] (string) The given auth key
