$sourcePath				*yii/debug/UserswitchAsset::$sourcePath*

 (string) 

 The directory that contains the source asset files for this asset bundle. A
 source asset file is a file that is part of your source code repository of
 your Web application.

 You must set this property if the directory containing the source asset files
 is not Web accessible. By setting this property, 'AssetManager' will publish
 the source asset files to a Web-accessible directory automatically when the
 asset bundle is registered on a page.

 If you do not set this property, it means the source asset files are located
 under 'basePath'.

 You can use either a directory or an alias of the directory.



$js					*yii/debug/UserswitchAsset::$js*

 (array) 

 List of JavaScript files that this bundle contains. Each JavaScript file can
 be specified in one of the following formats:


   - an absolute URL representing an external asset. For example,  
 'http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.1/jquery.min.js' or  
 '//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.1/jquery.min.js'. 
   - a relative path representing a local asset (e.g. 'js/main.js').
   The actual file path of a local   asset can be determined by prefixing
 'basePath' to the relative path, and the actual URL   of the asset can be
 determined by prefixing 'baseUrl' to the relative path. 
   - an array, with the first entry being the URL or relative path as
   described before, and a list of key => value pairs   that will be used to
 overwrite 'jsOptions' settings for this entry.   This functionality is
 available since version 2.0.7.

 Note that only a forward slash "/" should be used as directory separator.
