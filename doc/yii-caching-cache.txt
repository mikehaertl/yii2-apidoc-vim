DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A data item can be stored in the cache by calling 'set()' and be retrieved
 back later (in the same or different request) by 'get()'. In both operations,
 a key identifying the data item is required. An expiration time and/or a
 'Dependency|dependency' can also be specified when calling 'set()'. If the
 data item expires or the dependency changes at the time of calling 'get()',
 the cache will return no data.

 A typical usage pattern of cache is like the following:

   $key = 'demo';
   $data = $cache->get($key);
   if ($data === false) {
       // ...generate $data here...
       $cache->set($key, $data, $duration, $dependency);
   }

 Because Cache implements the '\ArrayAccess' interface, it can be used like an
 array. For example,

   $cache['foo'] = 'some data';
   echo $cache['foo'];

 Derived classes should implement the following methods which do the actual
 cache storage operations:


   - 'getValue()': retrieve the value with a key (if any) from cache 
   - 'setValue()': store the value with a key into cache 
   - 'addValue()': store the value only if the cache does not have this
   key before 
   - 'deleteValue()': delete the value with the specified key from
   cache 
   - 'flushValues()': delete all values from cache

 For more details and usage information on Cache, see the [guide article on
 caching](guide:caching-overview).


PROPERTY DETAILS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Inherited properties:

 |yii/base/Component::$behaviors|


$keyPrefix				*yii/caching/Cache::$keyPrefix*

 (string) A string prefixed to every cache key so that it is unique globally
 in the whole cache storage. It is recommended that you set a unique cache key
 prefix for each application if the same cache storage is being used by
 different applications.

 To ensure interoperability, only alphanumeric characters should be used.

$serializer				*yii/caching/Cache::$serializer*

 (null|array|false) The functions used to serialize and unserialize cached
 data. Defaults to null, meaning using the default PHP 'serialize()' and
 'unserialize()' functions. If you want to use some more efficient serializer
 (e.g. [igbinary](https://pecl.php.net/package/igbinary)), you may configure
 this property with a two-element array. The first element specifies the
 serialization function, and the second the deserialization function. If this
 property is set false, data will be directly sent to and retrieved from the
 underlying cache component without any serialization or deserialization. You
 should not turn off serialization if you are using 'Dependency|cache
 dependency', because it relies on data serialization. Also, some
 implementations of the cache can not correctly save and retrieve data
 different from a string type.

$defaultDuration			*yii/caching/Cache::$defaultDuration*

 (int) Default duration in seconds before a cache entry will expire. Default
 value is 0, meaning infinity. This value is used by 'set()' if the duration
 is not explicitly given.

*yii/caching/Cache::init*					public
>
 init()
<
return (void)

 Initializes the object.



 This method is invoked at the end of the constructor after the object is
 initialized with the given configuration.




*yii/caching/Cache::buildKey*				public
>
 buildKey($key)
<
return (string) The generated cache key

 Builds a normalized cache key from a given key.

 If the given key is a string containing alphanumeric characters only and no
 more than 32 characters, then the key will be returned back prefixed with
 'keyPrefix'. Otherwise, a normalized key is generated by serializing the
 given key, applying MD5 hashing, and prefixing with 'keyPrefix'.

    [$key] (mixed) The key to be normalized


*yii/caching/Cache::get*					public
>
 get($key)
<
return (mixed) The value stored in cache, false if the value is not in the cache,
expired, or the dependency associated with the cached data has changed.

 Retrieves a value from cache with a specified key.

    [$key] (mixed) A key identifying the cached value. This can be a simple
    string or a complex data structure consisting of factors representing the
    key.


*yii/caching/Cache::exists*				public
>
 exists($key)
<
return (bool) True if a value exists in cache, false if the value is not in the cache
or expired.

 Checks whether a specified key exists in the cache.

 This can be faster than getting the value from the cache if the data is big.
 In case a cache does not support this feature natively, this method will try
 to simulate it but has no performance improvement over getting it. Note that
 this method does not check whether the dependency associated with the cached
 data, if there is any, has changed. So a call to 'get' may return false while
 exists returns true.

    [$key] (mixed) A key identifying the cached value. This can be a simple
    string or a complex data structure consisting of factors representing the
    key.


*yii/caching/Cache::mget*					public
>
 mget($keys)
<
return (array) List of cached values corresponding to the specified keys. The array
is returned in terms of (key, value) pairs. If a value is not cached or
expired, the corresponding array value will be false.

 Retrieves multiple values from cache with the specified keys.

 Some caches (such as memcache, apc) allow retrieving multiple cached values
 at the same time, which may improve the performance. In case a cache does not
 support this feature natively, this method will try to simulate it.

    [$keys] (string[]) List of string keys identifying the cached values


*yii/caching/Cache::multiGet*				public
>
 multiGet($keys)
<
return (array) List of cached values corresponding to the specified keys. The array
is returned in terms of (key, value) pairs. If a value is not cached or
expired, the corresponding array value will be false.

 Retrieves multiple values from cache with the specified keys.

 Some caches (such as memcache, apc) allow retrieving multiple cached values
 at the same time, which may improve the performance. In case a cache does not
 support this feature natively, this method will try to simulate it.

    [$keys] (string[]) List of string keys identifying the cached values


*yii/caching/Cache::set*					public

    simple string or a complex data structure consisting of factors
    representing the key.
    [$value] (mixed) The value to be cached
    [$duration] (int) Default duration in seconds before the cache will
    expire. If not set, default 'defaultDuration' value is used.
    [$dependency] (\yii\caching\Dependency) Dependency of the cached item. If
    the dependency changes, the corresponding value in the cache will be
    invalidated when it is fetched via 'get()'. This parameter is ignored if
    'serializer' is false.


*yii/caching/Cache::mset*					public

*yii/caching/Cache::flushValues*				protected
>
 flushValues()
<
return (bool) Whether the flush operation was successful.

 Child classes may implement this method to realize the flush operation.


*yii/caching/Cache::getValues*				protected
>
 getValues($keys)
<
return (array) A list of cached values indexed by the keys

 Retrieves multiple values from cache with the specified keys.

 The default implementation calls 'getValue()' multiple times to retrieve the
 cached values one by one. If the underlying cache storage supports multiget,
 this method should be overridden to exploit that feature.

    [$keys] (array) A list of keys identifying the cached values


*yii/caching/Cache::setValues*				protected
>
 setValues($data, $duration)
<
return (array) Array of failed keys

 Stores multiple key-value pairs in cache.

 The default implementation calls 'setValue()' multiple times store values one
 by one. If the underlying cache storage supports multi-set, this method
 should be overridden to exploit that feature.

    [$data] (array) Array where key corresponds to cache key while value is
    the value stored
    [$duration] (int) The number of seconds in which the cached values will
    expire. 0 means never expire.


*yii/caching/Cache::addValues*				protected
>
 addValues($data, $duration)
<
return (array) Array of failed keys

 Adds multiple key-value pairs to cache.

 The default implementation calls 'addValue()' multiple times add values one
 by one. If the underlying cache storage supports multi-add, this method
 should be overridden to exploit that feature.

    the value stored.
    [$duration] (int) The number of seconds in which the cached values will
    expire. 0 means never expire.


*yii/caching/Cache::offsetExists*				public
>
 offsetExists($key)
<
return (bool) 

 Returns whether there is a cache entry with a specified key.

 This method is required by the interface '\ArrayAccess'.

    [$key] (string) A key identifying the cached value


*yii/caching/Cache::offsetGet*				public
>
 offsetGet($key)
<
return (mixed) The value stored in cache, false if the value is not in the cache or
expired.

 Retrieves the value from cache with a specified key.

 This method is required by the interface '\ArrayAccess'.

    [$key] (string) A key identifying the cached value


*yii/caching/Cache::offsetSet*				public
>
 offsetSet($key, $value)
<
return (void)

 Stores the value identified by a key into cache.

 If the cache already contains such a key, the existing value will be replaced
 with the new ones. To add expiration and dependencies, use the 'set()'
 method. This method is required by the interface '\ArrayAccess'.

    [$key] (string) The key identifying the value to be cached
    [$value] (mixed) The value to be cached


*yii/caching/Cache::offsetUnset*				public

*yii/caching/Cache::getOrSet*				public
>
 getOrSet($key, $callable, $duration=null, $dependency='null')
<
return (mixed) Result of $callable execution

 Method combines both 'set()' and 'get()' methods to retrieve value identified
 by a $key, or to store the result of $callable execution if there is no cache
 available for the $key.

 Usage example:

   public function getTopProducts($count = 10) {
       $cache = $this->cache; // Could be Yii::$app->cache
       return $cache->getOrSet(['top-n-products', 'n' => $count], function
 ($cache) use ($count) {
           return Products::find()->mostPopular()->limit(10)->all();
       }, 1000);
   }



    [$key] (mixed) A key identifying the value to be cached. This can be a
    simple string or a complex data structure consisting of factors
    representing the key.
    [$callable] (callable|\Closure) The callable or closure that will be used
    to generate a value to be cached. If you use $callable that can return
    'false', then keep in mind that 'getOrSet()' may work inefficiently
    because the 'yii\caching\Cache::get()' method uses 'false' return value to
    indicate the data item is not found in the cache. Thus, caching of 'false'
    value will lead to unnecessary internal calls.
    [$duration] (int) Default duration in seconds before the cache will
    expire. If not set, 'defaultDuration' value will be used.
    [$dependency] (\yii\caching\Dependency) Dependency of the cached item. If
    the dependency changes, the corresponding value in the cache will be
    invalidated when it is fetched via 'get()'. This parameter is ignored if
    'serializer' is 'false'.
