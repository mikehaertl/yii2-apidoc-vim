*yii/db/ActiveQueryInterface*  
=============================

DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 That are methods for either normal queries that return active records but
 also relational queries in which the query represents a relation between two
 active record classes and will return related records only.

 A class implementing this interface should also use 'ActiveQueryTrait' and
 'ActiveRelationTrait'.



METHOD DETAILS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*yii/db/ActiveQueryInterface::asArray*			public
>
 asArray($value='true')
<
(static) The query object itself

    [$value] (boolean) Whether to return the query results in terms of arrays
    instead of Active Records.


*yii/db/ActiveQueryInterface::indexBy*			public
>
 indexBy($column)
<
(static) The query object itself

    [$column] (string|callable) The name of the column by which the query
    results should be indexed by. This can also be a callable (e.g. anonymous
    function) that returns the index value based on the given row or model
    data. The signature of the callable should be:

      $customer = new Customer;
      $customer->name = $name;
      $customer->email = $email;
      $customer->insert();




*yii/db/ActiveQueryInterface::with*			public
>
 with()
<
(static) The query object itself

 The parameters to this method can be either one or multiple strings, or a
 single array of relation names and the optional callbacks to customize the
 relations.

 A relation name can refer to a relation defined in
 'ActiveQueryTrait::modelClass|modelClass' or a sub-relation that stands for a
 relation of a related record. For example, 'orders.address' means the
 'address' relation defined in the model class corresponding to the 'orders'
 relation.

 The followings are some usage examples:

   $customer = Customer::findOne($id);
   $customer->name = $name;
   $customer->email = $email;
   $customer->update();




*yii/db/ActiveQueryInterface::via*			public
>
 via($relationName, $callable='null')
<
(static) The relation object itself.

    [$relationName] (string) The relation name. This refers to a relation
    declared in the 'ActiveRelationTrait::primaryModel|primaryModel' of the
    relation.
    [$callable] (callable) A PHP callback for customizing the relation
    associated with the pivot table. Its signature should be
    'function($query)', where '$query' is the query to be customized.


*yii/db/ActiveQueryInterface::findFor*			public
>
 findFor($name, $model)
<
(mixed) The related record(s)

 This method is invoked when a relation of an ActiveRecord is being accessed
 in a lazy fashion.
    [$name] (string) The relation name
    [$model] (\yii\db\ActiveRecordInterface) The primary model
