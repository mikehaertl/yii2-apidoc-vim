*yii/caching/FileCache*   >> |yii/caching/Cache|
=======================

DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 For each data value being cached, FileCache will store it in a separate file.
 The cache files are placed under 'cachePath'. FileCache will perform garbage
 collection automatically to remove expired cache files.

 Please refer to 'Cache' for common cache operations that are supported by
 FileCache.

 For more details and usage information on Cache, see the [guide article on
 caching](guide:caching-overview).


PROPERTY DETAILS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Inherited properties:

 |yii/caching/Cache::$serializer|
 |yii/caching/Cache::$defaultDuration|
 |yii/base/Component::$behaviors|


$keyPrefix				*yii/caching/FileCache::$keyPrefix*

 (string) A string prefixed to every cache key. This is needed when you store
 cache data under the same 'cachePath' for different applications to avoid
 conflict.

 To ensure interoperability, only alphanumeric characters should be used.

$cachePath				*yii/caching/FileCache::$cachePath*

 (string) The directory to store cache files. You may use [path
 alias](guide:concept-aliases) here. If not set, it will use the "cache"
 subdirectory under the application runtime path.

$cacheFileSuffix			*yii/caching/FileCache::$cacheFileSuffix*

 (string) Cache file suffix. Defaults to '.bin'.

$directoryLevel				*yii/caching/FileCache::$directoryLevel*

 (int) The level of sub-directories to store cache files. Defaults to 1. If
 the system has huge number of cache files (e.g. one million), you may use a
 bigger value (usually no bigger than 3). Using sub-directories is mainly to
 ensure the file system is not over burdened with a single directory having
 too many files.

$gcProbability				*yii/caching/FileCache::$gcProbability*

 (int) The probability (parts per million) that garbage collection (GC) should
 be performed when storing a piece of data in the cache. Defaults to 10,
 meaning 0.001% chance. This number should be between 0 and 1000000. A value 0
 means no GC will be performed at all.

$fileMode				*yii/caching/FileCache::$fileMode*

 (int) The permission to be set for newly created cache files. This value will
 be used by PHP chmod() function. No umask will be applied. If not set, the
 permission will be determined by the current environment.

$dirMode				*yii/caching/FileCache::$dirMode*

 (int) The permission to be set for newly created directories. This value will
 be used by PHP chmod() function. No umask will be applied. Defaults to 0775,
 meaning the directory is read-writable by owner and group, but read-only for
 other users.

*yii/caching/FileCache::init*				public
>
 init()
<
return (void)

 Initializes this component by ensuring the existence of the cache path.


*yii/caching/FileCache::exists*				public
>
 exists($key)
<
return (bool) True if a value exists in cache, false if the value is not in the cache
or expired.

 Checks whether a specified key exists in the cache.

 This can be faster than getting the value from the cache if the data is big.
 Note that this method does not check whether the dependency associated with
 the cached data, if there is any, has changed. So a call to 'get' may return
 false while exists returns true.

    [$key] (mixed) A key identifying the cached value. This can be a simple
    string or a complex data structure consisting of factors representing the
    key.


*yii/caching/FileCache::getValue*				protected
>
 getValue($key)
<
return (string|false) The value stored in cache, false if the value is not in the
cache or expired.

 Retrieves a value from cache with a specified key.

 This is the implementation of the method declared in the parent class.

    [$key] (string) A unique key identifying the cached value


*yii/caching/FileCache::setValue*				protected
>
 setValue($key, $value, $duration)
<
return (bool) True if the value is successfully stored into cache, false otherwise

 Stores a value identified by a key in cache.

 This is the implementation of the method declared in the parent class.

    [$key] (string) The key identifying the value to be cached
    [$value] (string) The value to be cached. Other types (If you have
    disabled 'serializer') unable to get is correct in 'getValue()'.
    [$duration] (int) The number of seconds in which the cached value will
    expire. 0 means never expire.


*yii/caching/FileCache::addValue*				protected
>
 addValue($key, $value, $duration)
<
return (bool) True if the value is successfully stored into cache, false otherwise

 Stores a value identified by a key into cache if the cache does not contain
 this key.

 This is the implementation of the method declared in the parent class.

    [$key] (string) The key identifying the value to be cached
    [$value] (string) The value to be cached. Other types (if you have
    disabled 'serializer') unable to get is correct in 'getValue()'.
    [$duration] (int) The number of seconds in which the cached value will
    expire. 0 means never expire.


*yii/caching/FileCache::deleteValue*			protected
>
 deleteValue($key)
<
return (bool) If no error happens during deletion

 Deletes a value with the specified key from cache This is the implementation
 of the method declared in the parent class.

    [$key] (string) The key of the value to be deleted


*yii/caching/FileCache::flushValues*			protected
>
 flushValues()
<
return (bool) Whether the flush operation was successful.

 Deletes all values from cache.

 This is the implementation of the method declared in the parent class.


*yii/caching/FileCache::getCacheFile*			protected
>
 getCacheFile($key)
<
return (string) The cache file path

 Returns the cache file path given the cache key.

    [$key] (string) Cache key


*yii/caching/FileCache::gc*				public
>
 gc($force='false', $expiredOnly='true')
<
return (void)

 Removes expired cache files.

    [$force] (bool) Whether to enforce the garbage collection regardless of
    'gcProbability'. Defaults to false, meaning the actual deletion happens
    with the probability as specified by 'gcProbability'.
    [$expiredOnly] (bool) Whether to removed expired cache files only. If
    false, all cache files under 'cachePath' will be removed.


*yii/caching/FileCache::gcRecursive*			protected
>
 gcRecursive($path, $expiredOnly)
<
return (void)

 Recursively removing expired cache files under a directory.

 This method is mainly used by 'gc()'.

    [$path] (string) The directory under which expired cache files are
    removed.
    [$expiredOnly] (bool) Whether to only remove expired cache files. If
    false, all files under '$path' will be removed.
