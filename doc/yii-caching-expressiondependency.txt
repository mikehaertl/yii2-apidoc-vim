==================================

DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ExpressionDependency will use 'eval()' to evaluate the PHP expression. The
 dependency is reported as unchanged if and only if the result of the
 expression is the same as the one evaluated when storing the data to cache.

 A PHP expression can be any PHP code that has a value. To learn more about
 what an expression is, please refer to the [php
 manual](http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.expressions.php).
