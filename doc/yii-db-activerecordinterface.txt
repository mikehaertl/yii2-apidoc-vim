*yii/db/ActiveRecordInterface*  
==============================



METHOD DETAILS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*yii/db/ActiveRecordInterface::primaryKey*		public
>
 primaryKey()
<
(string[]) The primary key name(s) for this AR class.

 Note that an array should be returned even when the record only has a single
 primary key.

 For the primary key **value** see 'getPrimaryKey()' instead.


*yii/db/ActiveRecordInterface::attributes*		public
>
 attributes()
<
(array) List of attribute names.



*yii/db/ActiveRecordInterface::getAttribute*		public
>
 getAttribute($name)
<
(mixed) The attribute value. Null if the attribute is not set or does not
exist.

 If this record is the result of a query and the attribute is not loaded, null
 will be returned.
    [$name] (string) The attribute name


*yii/db/ActiveRecordInterface::setAttribute*		public
>
 setAttribute($name, $value)
<
(void)

    [$name] (string) The attribute name.
    [$value] (mixed) The attribute value.


*yii/db/ActiveRecordInterface::hasAttribute*		public
>
 hasAttribute($name)
<
(boolean) Whether the record has an attribute with the specified name.

    [$name] (string) The name of the attribute


*yii/db/ActiveRecordInterface::getPrimaryKey*		public
>
 getPrimaryKey($asArray='false')
<
(mixed) The primary key value. An array (attribute name => attribute value) is
returned if the primary key is composite or '$asArray' is true. A string is
returned otherwise (null will be returned if the key value is null).

    [$asArray] (boolean) Whether to return the primary key value as an array.
    If true, the return value will be an array with attribute names as keys
    and attribute values as values. Note that for composite primary keys, an
    array will always be returned regardless of this parameter value.


*yii/db/ActiveRecordInterface::getOldPrimaryKey*		public
>
 getOldPrimaryKey($asArray='false')
<
(mixed) The old primary key value. An array (column name => column value) is
returned if the primary key is composite or '$asArray' is true. A string is
returned otherwise (null will be returned if the key value is null).

 This refers to the primary key value that is populated into the record after
 executing a find method (e.g. find(), findOne()). The value remains unchanged
 even if the primary key attribute is manually assigned with a different
 value.
    [$asArray] (boolean) Whether to return the primary key value as an array.
    If true, the return value will be an array with column name as key and
    column value as value. If this is false (default), a scalar value will be
    returned for non-composite primary key.


*yii/db/ActiveRecordInterface::isPrimaryKey*		public
>
 isPrimaryKey($keys)
<
(boolean) Whether the given set of attributes represents the primary key for
this model

    [$keys] (array) The set of attributes to check


*yii/db/ActiveRecordInterface::find*			public
>
 find()
<
(\yii\db\ActiveQueryInterface) The newly created
'ActiveQueryInterface|ActiveQuery' instance.

 The returned 'ActiveQueryInterface|ActiveQuery' instance can be further
 customized by calling methods defined in 'ActiveQueryInterface' before
 'one()' or 'all()' is called to return populated ActiveRecord instances. For
 example,

   return [
       'email',
       'firstName' => 'first_name',
       'lastName' => 'last_name',
       'fullName' => function () {
           return $this->first_name . ' ' . $this->last_name;
       },
   ];

 This method is also called by 'BaseActiveRecord::hasOne()' and
 'BaseActiveRecord::hasMany()' to create a relational query.

 You may override this method to return a customized query. For example,

   return [
       // ...
       'bootstrap' => [
           "path\\to\\MyBootstrapClass1",
           [
               'class' => "path\\to\\MyBootstrapClass2",
               'prop1' => 'value1',
               'prop2' => 'value2',
           ],
       ],
   ];

 The following code shows how to apply a default condition for all queries:

 '''php class Customer extends ActiveRecord {     public static function
 find()     {         return parent::find()->where(['deleted' => false]);    
 } }

 // Use andWhere()/orWhere() to apply the default condition // SELECT FROM
 customer WHERE 'deleted'=:deleted AND age>30 $customers =
 Customer::find()->andWhere('age>30')->all();

 // Use where() to ignore the default condition // SELECT FROM customer WHERE
 age>30 $customers = Customer::find()->where('age>30')->all();


*yii/db/ActiveRecordInterface::findOne*			public
>
 findOne($condition)
<
(static) ActiveRecord instance matching the condition, or null if nothing
matches.

 The method accepts:

  
   - a scalar value (integer or string): query by a single primary key
   value and return the    corresponding record (or null if not found).  
   - an array of name-value pairs: query by a set of attribute values
   and return a single record    matching all of them (or null if not found).

 Note that this method will automatically call the 'one()' method and return
 an 'ActiveRecordInterface|ActiveRecord' instance. For example,

   // find the customer whose ID is 1
   $customer = Customer::find()->where(['id' => 1])->one();

   // find all active customers and order them by their age:
   $customers = Customer::find()
       ->where(['status' => 1])
       ->orderBy('age')
       ->all();


    [$condition] (mixed) Primary key value or a set of column values


*yii/db/ActiveRecordInterface::findAll*			public
>
 findAll($condition)
<
(array) An array of ActiveRecord instance, or an empty array if nothing
matches.

 The method accepts:

  
   - a scalar value (integer or string): query by a single primary key
   value and return an array containing the    corresponding record (or an
 empty array if not found).  
   - an array of scalar values (integer or string): query by a list of
   primary key values and return the    corresponding records (or an empty
 array if none was found).    Note that an empty condition will result in an
 empty result as it will be interpreted as a search for    primary keys and
 not an empty 'WHERE' condition.  
   - an array of name-value pairs: query by a set of attribute values
   and return an array of records    matching all of them (or an empty array
 if none was found).

 Note that this method will automatically call the 'all()' method and return
 an array of 'ActiveRecordInterface|ActiveRecord' instances. For example,

   class Customer extends ActiveRecord
   {
       public static function find()
       {
           // use CustomerQuery instead of the default ActiveQuery
           return new CustomerQuery(get_called_class());
       }
   }


    [$condition] (mixed) Primary key value or a set of column values


*yii/db/ActiveRecordInterface::updateAll*			public
>
 updateAll($attributes, $condition='null')
<
(integer) The number of rows updated

 For example, to change the status to be 1 for all customers whose status is
 2:

   // find a single customer whose primary key value is 10
   $customer = Customer::findOne(10);

   // the above code is equivalent to:
   $customer = Customer::find()->where(['id' => 10])->one();

   // find the first customer whose age is 30 and whose status is 1
   $customer = Customer::findOne(['age' => 30, 'status' => 1]);

   // the above code is equivalent to:
   $customer = Customer::find()->where(['age' => 30, 'status' => 1])->one();


    [$attributes] (array) Attribute values (name-value pairs) to be saved for
    the record. Unlike 'update()' these are not going to be validated.
    [$condition] (array) The condition that matches the records that should
    get updated. Please refer to 'QueryInterface::where()' on how to specify
    this parameter. An empty condition will match all records.


*yii/db/ActiveRecordInterface::deleteAll*			public
>
 deleteAll($condition='null')
<
(integer) The number of rows deleted

 WARNING: If you do not specify any condition, this method will delete ALL
 rows in the table.

 For example, to delete all customers whose status is 3:

   // find the customers whose primary key value is 10
   $customers = Customer::findAll(10);

   // the above code is equivalent to:
   $customers = Customer::find()->where(['id' => 10])->all();

   // find the customers whose primary key value is 10, 11 or 12.
   $customers = Customer::findAll([10, 11, 12]);

   // the above code is equivalent to:
   $customers = Customer::find()->where(['id' => [10, 11, 12]])->all();

   // find customers whose age is 30 and whose status is 1
   $customers = Customer::findAll(['age' => 30, 'status' => 1]);

   // the above code is equivalent to:
   $customers = Customer::find()->where(['age' => 30, 'status' => 1])->all();


    [$condition] (array) The condition that matches the records that should
    get deleted. Please refer to 'QueryInterface::where()' on how to specify
    this parameter. An empty condition will match all records.


*yii/db/ActiveRecordInterface::save*			public
>
 save($runValidation='true', $attributeNames='null')
<
(boolean) Whether the saving succeeds

 This method will call 'insert()' when 'getIsNewRecord()|isNewRecord' is true,
 or 'update()' when 'getIsNewRecord()|isNewRecord' is false.

 For example, to save a customer record:

   Customer::updateAll(['status' => 1], ['status' => '2']);


    [$runValidation] (boolean) Whether to perform validation before saving the
    record. If the validation fails, the record will not be saved to database.
    'false' will be returned in this case.
    [$attributeNames] (array) List of attributes that need to be saved.
    Defaults to null, meaning all attributes that are loaded from DB will be
    saved.


*yii/db/ActiveRecordInterface::insert*			public
>
 insert($runValidation='true', $attributes='null')
<
(boolean) Whether the attributes are valid and the record is inserted
successfully.

 Usage example:

   Customer::deleteAll([status = 3]);


    [$runValidation] (boolean) Whether to perform validation before saving the
    record. If the validation fails, the record will not be inserted into the
    database.
    [$attributes] (array) List of attributes that need to be saved. Defaults
    to null, meaning all attributes that are loaded from DB will be saved.


*yii/db/ActiveRecordInterface::update*			public
>
 update($runValidation='true', $attributeNames='null')
<
(integer|boolean) The number of rows affected, or false if validation fails or
updating process is stopped for other reasons. Note that it is possible that
the number of rows affected is 0, even though the update execution is
successful.

 Usage example:

   $customer = new Customer; // or $customer = Customer::findOne($id);
   $customer->name = $name;
   $customer->email = $email;
   $customer->save();


    [$runValidation] (boolean) Whether to perform validation before saving the
    record. If the validation fails, the record will not be inserted into the
    database.
    [$attributeNames] (array) List of attributes that need to be saved.
    Defaults to null, meaning all attributes that are loaded from DB will be
    saved.


*yii/db/ActiveRecordInterface::delete*			public
>
 delete()
<
(integer|boolean) The number of rows deleted, or false if the deletion is
unsuccessful for some reason. Note that it is possible that the number of rows
deleted is 0, even though the deletion execution is successful.



*yii/db/ActiveRecordInterface::getIsNewRecord*		public
>
 getIsNewRecord()
<
(boolean) Whether the record is new and should be inserted when calling
'save()'.



*yii/db/ActiveRecordInterface::equals*			public
>
 equals($record)
<
(boolean) Whether the two active records refer to the same row in the same
database table.

 Two 'getIsNewRecord()|new' records are considered to be not equal.
    [$record] (static) Record to compare to


*yii/db/ActiveRecordInterface::getRelation*		public
>
 getRelation($name, $throwException='true')
<
(\yii\db\ActiveQueryInterface) The relational query object

 A relation is defined by a getter method which returns an object implementing
 the 'ActiveQueryInterface' (normally this would be a relational 'ActiveQuery'
 object). It can be declared in either the ActiveRecord class itself or one of
 its behaviors.
    [$name] (string) The relation name
    [$throwException] (boolean) Whether to throw exception if the relation
    does not exist.


*yii/db/ActiveRecordInterface::link*			public
>
 link($name, $model, $extraColumns='[]')
<
(void)

 The relationship is established by setting the foreign key value(s) in one
 record to be the corresponding primary key value(s) in the other record. The
 record with the foreign key will be saved into database without performing
 validation.

 If the relationship involves a pivot table, a new row will be inserted into
 the pivot table which contains the primary key values from both records.

 This method requires that the primary key value is not null.
    [$name] (string) The case sensitive name of the relationship.
    [$model] (static) The record to be linked with the current one.
    [$extraColumns] (array) Additional column values to be saved into the
    pivot table. This parameter is only meaningful for a relationship
    involving a pivot table (i.e., a relation set with
    ''ActiveQueryInterface::via()''.)


*yii/db/ActiveRecordInterface::unlink*			public
>
 unlink($name, $model, $delete='false')
<
(void)

 The record with the foreign key of the relationship will be deleted if
 '$delete' is true. Otherwise, the foreign key will be set null and the record
 will be saved without validation.
    [$name] (string) The case sensitive name of the relationship.
    [$model] (static) The model to be unlinked from the current one.
    [$delete] (boolean) Whether to delete the model that contains the foreign
    key. If false, the model's foreign key will be set null and saved. If
    true, the model containing the foreign key will be deleted.
