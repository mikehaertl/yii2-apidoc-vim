==============================



METHOD DETAILS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*yii/db/ActiveRecordInterface::instance*			public

 See |yii/base/StaticInstanceInterface::instance|


*yii/db/ActiveRecordInterface::primaryKey*		public
>
 primaryKey()
<
return (string[]) The primary key name(s) for this AR class.

 Returns the primary key **name(s)** for this AR class.

 Note that an array should be returned even when the record only has a single
 primary key.

 For the primary key **value** see 'getPrimaryKey()' instead.


*yii/db/ActiveRecordInterface::attributes*		public
>
 attributes()
<
return (array) List of attribute names.

 Returns the list of all attribute names of the record.


*yii/db/ActiveRecordInterface::getAttribute*		public
>
 getAttribute($name)
<
return (mixed) The attribute value. 'null' if the attribute is not set or does not
exist.

 Returns the named attribute value.

 If this record is the result of a query and the attribute is not loaded,
 'null' will be returned.

    [$name] (string) The attribute name


*yii/db/ActiveRecordInterface::setAttribute*		public
>
 setAttribute($name, $value)
<
return (void)

 Sets the named attribute value.

    [$name] (string) The attribute name.
    [$value] (mixed) The attribute value.


*yii/db/ActiveRecordInterface::hasAttribute*		public
>
 hasAttribute($name)
<
return (bool) Whether the record has an attribute with the specified name.

 Returns a value indicating whether the record has an attribute with the
 specified name.

    [$name] (string) The name of the attribute


*yii/db/ActiveRecordInterface::getPrimaryKey*		public
>
 getPrimaryKey($asArray='false')
<
return (mixed) The primary key value. An array (attribute name => attribute value) is
returned if the primary key is composite or '$asArray' is true. A string is
returned otherwise ('null' will be returned if the key value is 'null').

 Returns the primary key value(s).

    [$asArray] (bool) Whether to return the primary key value as an array. If
    true, the return value will be an array with attribute names as keys and
    attribute values as values. Note that for composite primary keys, an array
    will always be returned regardless of this parameter value.


*yii/db/ActiveRecordInterface::getOldPrimaryKey*		public
>
 getOldPrimaryKey($asArray='false')
<
return (mixed) The old primary key value. An array (column name => column value) is
returned if the primary key is composite or '$asArray' is true. A string is
returned otherwise ('null' will be returned if the key value is 'null').

 Returns the old primary key value(s).

 This refers to the primary key value that is populated into the record after
 executing a find method (e.g. find(), findOne()). The value remains unchanged
 even if the primary key attribute is manually assigned with a different
 value.

    [$asArray] (bool) Whether to return the primary key value as an array. If
    true, the return value will be an array with column name as key and column
    value as value. If this is 'false' (default), a scalar value will be
    returned for non-composite primary key.


*yii/db/ActiveRecordInterface::isPrimaryKey*		public
>
 isPrimaryKey($keys)
<
return (bool) Whether the given set of attributes represents the primary key for this
model

 Returns a value indicating whether the given set of attributes represents the
 primary key for this model.

    [$keys] (array) The set of attributes to check


*yii/db/ActiveRecordInterface::find*			public
>
 find()
<
return (\yii\db\ActiveQueryInterface) The newly created 'ActiveQueryInterface'
instance.

 Creates an 'ActiveQueryInterface' instance for query purpose.

 The returned 'ActiveQueryInterface' instance can be further customized by
 calling methods defined in 'ActiveQueryInterface' before 'one()' or 'all()'
 is called to return populated ActiveRecord instances. For example,

   // find the customer whose ID is 1
   $customer = Customer::find()->where(['id' => 1])->one();

   // find all active customers and order them by their age:
   $customers = Customer::find()
       ->where(['status' => 1])
       ->orderBy('age')
       ->all();

 This method is also called by 'BaseActiveRecord::hasOne()' and
 'BaseActiveRecord::hasMany()' to create a relational query.

 You may override this method to return a customized query. For example,

   class Customer extends ActiveRecord
   {
       public static function find()
       {
           // use CustomerQuery instead of the default ActiveQuery
           return new CustomerQuery(get_called_class());
       }
   }

 The following code shows how to apply a default condition for all queries:

 '''php class Customer extends ActiveRecord {     public static function
 find()     {         return parent::find()->where(['deleted' => false]);    
 } }

 // Use andWhere()/orWhere() to apply the default condition // SELECT FROM
 customer WHERE 'deleted'=:deleted AND age>30 $customers =
 Customer::find()->andWhere('age>30')->all();

 // Use where() to ignore the default condition // SELECT FROM customer WHERE
 age>30 $customers = Customer::find()->where('age>30')->all();


*yii/db/ActiveRecordInterface::findOne*			public
>
 findOne($condition)
<
return (static) ActiveRecord instance matching the condition, or 'null' if nothing
matches.

 Returns a single active record model instance by a primary key or an array of
 column values.

 The method accepts:

  
   - a scalar value (integer or string): query by a single primary key
   value and return the    corresponding record (or 'null' if not found).  
   - a non-associative array: query by a list of primary key values and
   return the    first record (or 'null' if not found).  
   - an associative array of name-value pairs: query by a set of
   attribute values and return a single record    matching all of them (or
 'null' if not found). Note that '['id' => 1, 2]' is treated as a
 non-associative array.    Column names are limited to current records table
 columns for SQL DBMS, or filtered otherwise to be limited to simple filter
 conditions.

 That this method will automatically call the 'one()' method and return an
 'ActiveRecordInterface|ActiveRecord' instance.

 > Note: As this is a short-hand method only, using more complex conditions,
 like ['!=', 'id', 1] will not work. > If you need to specify more complex
 conditions, use 'find()' in combination with 'ActiveQuery::where()|where()'
 instead.

 See the following code for usage examples:

   // find a single customer whose primary key value is 10
   $customer = Customer::findOne(10);

   // the above code is equivalent to:
   $customer = Customer::find()->where(['id' => 10])->one();

   // find the customers whose primary key value is 10, 11 or 12.
   $customers = Customer::findOne([10, 11, 12]);

   // the above code is equivalent to:
   $customers = Customer::find()->where(['id' => [10, 11, 12]])->one();

   // find the first customer whose age is 30 and whose status is 1
   $customer = Customer::findOne(['age' => 30, 'status' => 1]);

   // the above code is equivalent to:
   $customer = Customer::find()->where(['age' => 30, 'status' => 1])->one();

 If you need to pass user input to this method, make sure the input value is
 scalar or in case of array condition, make sure the array structure can not
 be changed from the outside:

   // yii\web\Controller ensures that $id is scalar
   public function actionView($id)
   {
       $model = Post::findOne($id);
       // ...
   }

   // explicitly specifying the colum to search, passing a scalar or array
 here will always result in finding a single record
   $model = Post::findOne(['id' => Yii::$app->request->get('id')]);

   // do NOT use the following code! it is possible to inject an array
 condition to filter by arbitrary column values!
   $model = Post::findOne(Yii::$app->request->get('id'));



    [$condition] (mixed) Primary key value or a set of column values


*yii/db/ActiveRecordInterface::findAll*			public
>
 findAll($condition)
<
return (array) An array of ActiveRecord instance, or an empty array if nothing
matches.

 Returns a list of active record models that match the specified primary key
 value(s) or a set of column values.

 The method accepts:

  
   - a scalar value (integer or string): query by a single primary key
   value and return an array containing the    corresponding record (or an
 empty array if not found).  
   - a non-associative array: query by a list of primary key values and
   return the    corresponding records (or an empty array if none was found). 
   Note that an empty condition will result in an empty result as it will be
 interpreted as a search for    primary keys and not an empty 'WHERE'
 condition.  
   - an associative array of name-value pairs: query by a set of
   attribute values and return an array of records    matching all of them (or
 an empty array if none was found). Note that '['id' => 1, 2]' is treated as  
  a non-associative array.    Column names are limited to current records
 table columns for SQL DBMS, or filtered otherwise to be limted to simple
 filter conditions.

 This method will automatically call the 'all()' method and return an array of
 'ActiveRecordInterface|ActiveRecord' instances.

 > Note: As this is a short-hand method only, using more complex conditions,
 like ['!=', 'id', 1] will not work. > If you need to specify more complex
 conditions, use 'find()' in combination with 'ActiveQuery::where()|where()'
 instead.

 See the following code for usage examples:

   // find the customers whose primary key value is 10
   $customers = Customer::findAll(10);

   // the above code is equivalent to:
   $customers = Customer::find()->where(['id' => 10])->all();

   // find the customers whose primary key value is 10, 11 or 12.
   $customers = Customer::findAll([10, 11, 12]);

   // the above code is equivalent to:
   $customers = Customer::find()->where(['id' => [10, 11, 12]])->all();

   // find customers whose age is 30 and whose status is 1
   $customers = Customer::findAll(['age' => 30, 'status' => 1]);

   // the above code is equivalent to:
   $customers = Customer::find()->where(['age' => 30, 'status' => 1])->all();

 If you need to pass user input to this method, make sure the input value is
 scalar or in case of array condition, make sure the array structure can not
 be changed from the outside:

   // yii\web\Controller ensures that $id is scalar
   public function actionView($id)
   {
       $model = Post::findOne($id);
       // ...
   }

   // explicitly specifying the colum to search, passing a scalar or array
 here will always result in finding a single record
   $model = Post::findOne(['id' => Yii::$app->request->get('id')]);

   // do NOT use the following code! it is possible to inject an array
 condition to filter by arbitrary column values!
   $model = Post::findOne(Yii::$app->request->get('id'));



    [$condition] (mixed) Primary key value or a set of column values


*yii/db/ActiveRecordInterface::updateAll*			public
>
 updateAll($attributes, $condition='null')
<
return (int) The number of rows updated

 For example, to change the status to be 1 for all customers whose status is
 2:

   Customer::updateAll(['status' => 1], ['status' => '2']);



    [$attributes] (array) Attribute values (name-value pairs) to be saved for
    the record. Unlike 'update()' these are not going to be validated.
    [$condition] (array) The condition that matches the records that should
    get updated. Please refer to 'QueryInterface::where()' on how to specify
    this parameter. An empty condition will match all records.


*yii/db/ActiveRecordInterface::deleteAll*			public
>
 deleteAll($condition='null')
<
return (int) The number of rows deleted

 Deletes records using the provided conditions.

 WARNING: If you do not specify any condition, this method will delete ALL
 rows in the table.

 For example, to delete all customers whose status is 3:

   Customer::deleteAll([status = 3]);



    [$condition] (array) The condition that matches the records that should
    get deleted. Please refer to 'QueryInterface::where()' on how to specify
    this parameter. An empty condition will match all records.


*yii/db/ActiveRecordInterface::save*			public
>
 save($runValidation='true', $attributeNames='null')
<
return (bool) Whether the saving succeeded (i.e. no validation errors occurred).

 Saves the current record.

 This method will call 'insert()' when 'getIsNewRecord()|isNewRecord' is true,
 or 'update()' when 'getIsNewRecord()|isNewRecord' is false.

 For example, to save a customer record:

   $customer = new Customer; // or $customer = Customer::findOne($id);
   $customer->name = $name;
   $customer->email = $email;
   $customer->save();



    [$runValidation] (bool) Whether to perform validation (calling
    '\yii\base\Model::validate()|validate()') before saving the record.
    Defaults to 'true'. If the validation fails, the record will not be saved
    to the database and this method will return 'false'.
    [$attributeNames] (array) List of attribute names that need to be saved.
    Defaults to 'null', meaning all attributes that are loaded from DB will be
    saved.


*yii/db/ActiveRecordInterface::insert*			public
>
 insert($runValidation='true', $attributes='null')
<
return (bool) Whether the attributes are valid and the record is inserted
successfully.

 Inserts the record into the database using the attribute values of this
 record.

 Usage example:

   $customer = new Customer;
   $customer->name = $name;
   $customer->email = $email;
   $customer->insert();



    [$runValidation] (bool) Whether to perform validation (calling
    '\yii\base\Model::validate()|validate()') before saving the record.
    Defaults to 'true'. If the validation fails, the record will not be saved
    to the database and this method will return 'false'.
    [$attributes] (array) List of attributes that need to be saved. Defaults
    to 'null', meaning all attributes that are loaded from DB will be saved.


*yii/db/ActiveRecordInterface::update*			public
>
 update($runValidation='true', $attributeNames='null')
<
return (int|bool) The number of rows affected, or 'false' if validation fails or
updating process is stopped for other reasons. Note that it is possible that
the number of rows affected is 0, even though the update execution is
successful.

 Saves the changes to this active record into the database.

 Usage example:

   $customer = Customer::findOne($id);
   $customer->name = $name;
   $customer->email = $email;
   $customer->update();



    [$runValidation] (bool) Whether to perform validation (calling
    '\yii\base\Model::validate()|validate()') before saving the record.
    Defaults to 'true'. If the validation fails, the record will not be saved
    to the database and this method will return 'false'.
    [$attributeNames] (array) List of attributes that need to be saved.
    Defaults to 'null', meaning all attributes that are loaded from DB will be
    saved.


*yii/db/ActiveRecordInterface::delete*			public
>
 delete()
<
return (int|bool) The number of rows deleted, or 'false' if the deletion is
unsuccessful for some reason. Note that it is possible that the number of rows
deleted is 0, even though the deletion execution is successful.

 Deletes the record from the database.


*yii/db/ActiveRecordInterface::getIsNewRecord*		public
>
 getIsNewRecord()
<
return (bool) Whether the record is new and should be inserted when calling 'save()'.

 Returns a value indicating whether the current record is new (not saved in
 the database).


*yii/db/ActiveRecordInterface::equals*			public
>
 equals($record)
<
return (bool) Whether the two active records refer to the same row in the same
database table.

 Returns a value indicating whether the given active record is the same as the
 current one.

 Two 'getIsNewRecord()|new' records are considered to be not equal.

    [$record] (static) Record to compare to


*yii/db/ActiveRecordInterface::getRelation*		public
>
 getRelation($name, $throwException='true')
<
return (\yii\db\ActiveQueryInterface) The relational query object

 Returns the relation object with the specified name.

 A relation is defined by a getter method which returns an object implementing
 the 'ActiveQueryInterface' (normally this would be a relational 'ActiveQuery'
 object). It can be declared in either the ActiveRecord class itself or one of
 its behaviors.

    [$name] (string) The relation name, e.g. 'orders' for a relation defined
    via 'getOrders()' method (case-sensitive).
    [$throwException] (bool) Whether to throw exception if the relation does
    not exist.


*yii/db/ActiveRecordInterface::populateRelation*		public
>
 populateRelation($name, $records)
<
return (void)

 Populates the named relation with the related records.

 Note that this method does not check if the relation exists or not.

    [$name] (string) The relation name, e.g. 'orders' for a relation defined
    via 'getOrders()' method (case-sensitive).
    [$records] (\yii\db\ActiveRecordInterface|array|null) The related records
    to be populated into the relation.


*yii/db/ActiveRecordInterface::link*			public
>
 link($name, $model, $extraColumns='[]')
<
return (void)

 Establishes the relationship between two records.

 The relationship is established by setting the foreign key value(s) in one
 record to be the corresponding primary key value(s) in the other record. The
 record with the foreign key will be saved into database without performing
 validation.

 If the relationship involves a junction table, a new row will be inserted
 into the junction table which contains the primary key values from both
 records.

 This method requires that the primary key value is not 'null'.

    [$name] (string) The case sensitive name of the relationship, e.g.
    'orders' for a relation defined via 'getOrders()' method.
    [$model] (static) The record to be linked with the current one.
    [$extraColumns] (array) Additional column values to be saved into the
    junction table. This parameter is only meaningful for a relationship
    involving a junction table (i.e., a relation set with
    'ActiveQueryInterface::via()').


*yii/db/ActiveRecordInterface::unlink*			public
>
 unlink($name, $model, $delete='false')
<
return (void)

 Destroys the relationship between two records.

 The record with the foreign key of the relationship will be deleted if
 '$delete' is true. Otherwise, the foreign key will be set 'null' and the
 record will be saved without validation.

    [$name] (string) The case sensitive name of the relationship, e.g.
    'orders' for a relation defined via 'getOrders()' method.
    [$model] (static) The model to be unlinked from the current one.
    [$delete] (bool) Whether to delete the model that contains the foreign
    key. If false, the model's foreign key will be set 'null' and saved. If
    true, the model containing the foreign key will be deleted.


*yii/db/ActiveRecordInterface::getDb*			public
>
 getDb()
<
return (mixed) The database connection used by this AR class.

 Returns the connection used by this AR class.
