*yii/base/Security*   >> |yii/base/Component|
===================

DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In particular, Security supports the following features:


   - Encryption/decryption: 'encryptByKey()', 'decryptByKey()',
   'encryptByPassword()' and 'decryptByPassword()' 
   - Key derivation using standard algorithms: 'pbkdf2()' and 'hkdf()' 
   - Data tampering prevention: 'hashData()' and 'validateData()' 
   - Password validation: 'generatePasswordHash()' and
   'validatePassword()'

 > Note: this class requires 'OpenSSL' PHP extension for random key/string
 generation on Windows and for encryption/decryption on all platforms. For the
 highest security level PHP version >= 5.5.0 is recommended.


PROPERTY DETAILS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$cipher					*yii/base/Security::$cipher*

 (string) The cipher to use for encryption and decryption.

$allowedCiphers				*yii/base/Security::$allowedCiphers*

 (array[]) Look-up table of block sizes and key sizes for each supported
 OpenSSL cipher.

 In each element, the key is one of the ciphers supported by OpenSSL (@see
 openssl_get_cipher_methods()). The value is an array of two integers, the
 first is the cipher's block size in bytes and the second is the key size in
 bytes.

 > Warning: All OpenSSL ciphers that we recommend are in the default value,
 i.e. AES in CBC mode.

 > Note: Yii's encryption protocol uses the same size for cipher key, HMAC
 signature key and key derivation salt.

$kdfHash				*yii/base/Security::$kdfHash*

 (string) Hash algorithm for key derivation. Recommend sha256, sha384 or
 sha512.

$macHash				*yii/base/Security::$macHash*

 (string) Hash algorithm for message authentication. Recommend sha256, sha384
 or sha512.

$authKeyInfo				*yii/base/Security::$authKeyInfo*

 (string) HKDF info value for derivation of message authentication key.

$derivationIterations			*yii/base/Security::$derivationIterations*

 (integer) Derivation iterations count. Set as high as possible to hinder
 dictionary password attacks.

$passwordHashStrategy			*yii/base/Security::$passwordHashStrategy*

 (string) Strategy, which should be used to generate password hash. Available
 strategies: 
   - 'password_hash' - use of PHP 'password_hash()' function with
   PASSWORD_DEFAULT algorithm.   This option is recommended, but it requires
 PHP version >= 5.5.0 
   - 'crypt' - use PHP 'crypt()' function.

$passwordHashCost			*yii/base/Security::$passwordHashCost*

 (integer) Default cost used for password hashing. Allowed value is between 4
 and 31.

*yii/base/Security::encryptByPassword*			public
>
 encryptByPassword($data, $password)
<
return (string) The encrypted data

 Derives keys for encryption and authentication from the password using PBKDF2
 and a random salt, which is deliberately slow to protect against dictionary
 attacks. Use 'encryptByKey()' to encrypt fast using a cryptographic key
 rather than a password. Key derivation time is determined by
 '$derivationIterations', which should be set as high as possible. The
 encrypted data includes a keyed message authentication code (MAC) so there is
 no need to hash input or output data. > Note: Avoid encrypting with passwords
 wherever possible. Nothing can protect against poor-quality or compromised
 passwords.

    [$data] (string) The data to encrypt
    [$password] (string) The password to use for encryption


*yii/base/Security::encryptByKey*				public
>
 encryptByKey($data, $inputKey, $info='null')
<
return (string) The encrypted data

 Derives keys for encryption and authentication from the input key using HKDF
 and a random salt, which is very fast relative to 'encryptByPassword()'. The
 input key must be properly random -
   - use 'generateRandomKey()' to generate keys. The encrypted data includes a
 keyed message authentication code (MAC) so there is no need to hash input or
 output data.

    [$inputKey] (string) The input to use for encryption and authentication
    [$info] (string) Optional context and application specific information,

<
return (string) The derived key

 Implements HKDF2 specified in [RFC
 2898](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2898#section-5.2) Recommend use one of

*yii/base/Security::hashData*				public
>
 hashData($data, $key, $rawHash='false')
<
return (string) The data prefixed with the keyed hash

 There is no need to hash inputs or outputs of 'encryptByKey()' or
 'encryptByPassword()' as those methods perform the task.

    [$data] (string) The data to be protected
    [$key] (string) The secret key to be used for generating hash. Should be a
    secure cryptographic key.
    [$rawHash] (boolean) Whether the generated hash value is in raw binary
    format. If false, lowercase hex digits will be generated.


*yii/base/Security::validateData*				public
>
 validateData($data, $key, $rawHash='false')
<
return (string) The real data with the hash stripped off. False if the data is
tampered.

    [$data] (string) The data to be validated. The data must be previously
    generated by 'hashData()'.
    [$key] (string) The secret key that was previously used to generate the
    hash for the data in 'hashData()'. function to see the supported hashing
    algorithms on your system. This must be the same as the value passed to
    'hashData()' when generating the hash for the data.
    [$rawHash] (boolean) This should take the same value as when you generate
    the data using 'hashData()'. It indicates whether the hash value in the
    data is in binary format. If false, it means the hash value consists of
    lowercase hex digits only. hex digits will be generated.


*yii/base/Security::generateRandomKey*			public
>
 generateRandomKey($length=32)
<
return (string) The generated random bytes

 Note that output may not be ASCII.

    [$length] (integer) The number of bytes to generate


*yii/base/Security::generateRandomString*			public
>
 generateRandomString($length=32)
<
return (string) The generated random key

 The string generated matches [A-Za-z0-9_-]+ and is transparent to
 URL-encoding.

    [$length] (integer) The length of the key in characters


*yii/base/Security::generatePasswordHash*			public
>
 generatePasswordHash($password, $cost=null)
<
return (string) The password hash string. When 'passwordHashStrategy' is set to
'crypt', the output is always 60 ASCII characters, when set to 'password_hash'
the output length might increase in future versions of PHP
(http://php.net/manual/en/function.password-hash.php)

 The generated hash can be stored in database. Later when a password needs to
 be validated, the hash can be fetched and passed to 'validatePassword()'. For
 example,

   // generates the hash (usually done during user registration or when the
 password is changed)
   $hash = Yii::$app->getSecurity()->generatePasswordHash($password);
   // ...save $hash in database...

   // during login, validate if the password entered is correct using $hash
 fetched from database
   if (Yii::$app->getSecurity()->validatePassword($password, $hash) {
       // password is good
   } else {
       // password is bad
   }



    [$password] (string) The password to be hashed.
    [$cost] (integer) Cost parameter used by the Blowfish hash algorithm. The
    higher the value of cost, the longer it takes to generate the hash and to
    verify a password against it. Higher cost therefore slows down a
    brute-force attack. For best protection against brute-force attacks, set
    it to the highest value that is tolerable on production servers. The time
    taken to compute the hash doubles for every increment by one of $cost.


*yii/base/Security::validatePassword*			public
>
 validatePassword($password, $hash)
<
return (boolean) Whether the password is correct.

    [$password] (string) The password to verify.
    [$hash] (string) The hash to verify the password against.


*yii/base/Security::generateSalt*				protected
>
 generateSalt($cost=13)
<
return (string) The random salt value.

 The PHP [crypt()](http://php.net/manual/en/function.crypt.php) built-in
 function requires, for the Blowfish hash algorithm, a salt string in a
 specific format: "$2a$", "$2x$" or "$2y$", a two digit cost parameter, "$",
 and 22 characters from the alphabet "./0-9A-Za-z".

    [$cost] (integer) The cost parameter


*yii/base/Security::compareString*			public
>
 compareString($expected, $actual)
<
return (boolean) Whether strings are equal.

    [$expected] (string) String to compare.
    [$actual] (string) User-supplied string.
