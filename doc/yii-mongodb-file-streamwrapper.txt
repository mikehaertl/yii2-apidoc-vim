*yii/mongodb/file/StreamWrapper*   >> |yii/base/BaseObject|
================================

DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Before feature can be used this wrapper should be registered via 'register()'
 method. It is usually performed via
 'yii\mongodb\Connection::registerFileStreamWrapper()'.

 Note: do not use this class directly 
   - its instance will be created and maintained by PHP internally once
 corresponding stream resource is created.

 Resource path should be specified in following format:

 ''' 'protocol://databaseName.fileCollectionPrefix?file_attribute=value' '''

 Write example:

   $resource = fopen('gridfs://mydatabase.fs?filename=new_file.txt', 'w');
   fwrite($resource, 'some content');
   // ...
   fclose($resource);

 Read example:

   $resource = fopen('gridfs://mydatabase.fs?filename=my_file.txt', 'r');
   $fileContent = stream_get_contents($resource);




PROPERTY DETAILS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


$context				*yii/mongodb/file/StreamWrapper::$context*

 (resource) Associated stream resource context. This property is set
 automatically by PHP once wrapper is instantiated.

$contextOptions				*yii/mongodb/file/StreamWrapper::$contextOptions*

 (array) Context options.

*yii/mongodb/file/StreamWrapper::register*		public
>
 register($protocol=''gridfs'', $force='false')
<
return (void)

 Registers this steam wrapper.

    [$protocol] (string) Name of the protocol to be used.
    [$force] (bool) Whether to register wrapper, even if protocol is already
    taken.


*yii/mongodb/file/StreamWrapper::getContextOptions*	public
>
 getContextOptions()
<
return (array) Context options.

 Returns options associated with 'context'.


*yii/mongodb/file/StreamWrapper::stream_close*		public
>
 stream_close()
<
return (void)

 Closes a resource.

 This method is called in response to 'fclose()'.


*yii/mongodb/file/StreamWrapper::stream_eof*		public
>
 stream_eof()
<
return (bool) 'true' if the read/write position is at the end of the stream and if no
more data is available to be read, or 'false' otherwise.

 Tests for end-of-file on a file pointer.

 This method is called in response to 'feof()'.


*yii/mongodb/file/StreamWrapper::stream_open*		public
>
 stream_open($path, $mode, $options, $openedPath)
<
return (bool) Whether operation is successful.

 Opens file.

 This method is called immediately after the wrapper is initialized (f.e. by
 'fopen()' and 'file_get_contents()').

    [$path] (string) Specifies the URL that was passed to the original
    function.
    [$mode] (string) Mode used to open the file, as detailed for 'fopen()'.
    [$options] (int) Additional flags set by the streams API.
    [$openedPath] (string) Real opened path.


*yii/mongodb/file/StreamWrapper::stream_read*		public
>
 stream_read($count)
<
return (string|false) If there are less than count bytes available, return as many as
are available. If no more data is available, return 'false'.

 Reads from stream.

 This method is called in response to 'fread()' and 'fgets()'.

    [$count] (int) Count of bytes of data from the current position should be
    returned.


*yii/mongodb/file/StreamWrapper::stream_write*		public
>
 stream_write($data)
<
return (int) The number of bytes that were successfully stored.

 Writes to stream.

 This method is called in response to 'fwrite()'.

    [$data] (string) String to be stored into the underlying stream.


*yii/mongodb/file/StreamWrapper::stream_flush*		public
>
 stream_flush()
<
return (bool) Whether cached data was successfully stored.

 This method is called in response to 'fflush()' and when the stream is being
 closed while any unflushed data has been written to it before.


*yii/mongodb/file/StreamWrapper::stream_stat*		public
>
 stream_stat()
<
return (array) File statistic information.

 Retrieve information about a file resource.

 This method is called in response to 'stat()'.


*yii/mongodb/file/StreamWrapper::stream_seek*		public
>
 stream_seek($offset, $whence=SEEK_SET)
<
return (bool) Return true if the position was updated, false otherwise.

 Seeks to specific location in a stream.

 This method is called in response to 'fseek()'.

    [$offset] (int) The stream offset to seek to.
    [$whence] (int) Possible values:


      - SEEK_SET - Set position equal to offset bytes. 
      - SEEK_CUR - Set position to current location plus offset. 
      - SEEK_END - Set position to end-of-file plus offset.


*yii/mongodb/file/StreamWrapper::stream_tell*		public
>
 stream_tell()
<
return (int) Should return the current position of the stream.

 Retrieve the current position of a stream.

 This method is called in response to 'fseek()' to determine the current
 position.
