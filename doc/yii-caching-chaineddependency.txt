===============================

DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 When 'dependOnAll' is true, if any of the dependencies has changed, this
 dependency is considered changed; When 'dependOnAll' is false, if one of the
 dependencies has NOT changed, this dependency is considered NOT changed.

 For more details and usage information on Cache, see the [guide article on
 caching](guide:caching-overview).


PROPERTY DETAILS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$data					*yii/caching/ChainedDependency::$data*

 See |yii/caching/Dependency::$data|

$reusable				*yii/caching/ChainedDependency::$reusable*

 See |yii/caching/Dependency::$reusable|

$dependencies				*yii/caching/ChainedDependency::$dependencies*

 (\yii\caching\Dependency[]) List of dependencies that this dependency is
 composed of. Each array element must be a dependency object.

$dependOnAll				*yii/caching/ChainedDependency::$dependOnAll*

 (bool) Whether this dependency is depending on every dependency in
 'dependencies'. Defaults to true, meaning if any of the dependencies has
 changed, this dependency is considered changed. When it is set false, it
 means if one of the dependencies has NOT changed, this dependency is
 considered NOT changed.
