*yii/web/AssetManager*   >> |yii/base/Component|
======================

DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 AssetManager is configured as an application component in
 '\yii\web\Application' by default. You can access that instance via
 'Yii::$app->assetManager'.

 You can modify its configuration by adding an array to your application
 config under 'components' as it is shown in the following example:

   'assetManager' => [
       'bundles' => [
           // you can override AssetBundle configs here
       ],
       //'linkAssets' => true,
       // ...
   ]




PROPERTY DETAILS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$bundles				*yii/web/AssetManager::$bundles*
 (array) List of available asset bundles. The keys are the class names
 (**without leading backslash**) of the asset bundles, and the values are
 either the configuration arrays for creating the 'AssetBundle' objects or the
 corresponding asset bundle instances. For example, the following code
 disables the bootstrap css file used by Bootstrap widgets (because you want
 to use your own styles):

   [
       'yii\bootstrap\BootstrapAsset' => [
           'css' => [],
       ],
   ]



$basePath				*yii/web/AssetManager::$basePath*
 ()

$baseUrl				*yii/web/AssetManager::$baseUrl*
 ()

$linkAssets				*yii/web/AssetManager::$linkAssets*
 (boolean) Whether to use symbolic link to publish asset files. Defaults to
 false, meaning asset files are copied to 'basePath'. Using symbolic links has
 the benefit that the published assets will always be consistent with the
 source assets and there is no copy operation required. This is especially
 useful during development.

 However, there are special requirements for hosting environments in order to
 use symbolic links. In particular, symbolic links are supported only on
 Linux/Unix, and Windows Vista/2008 or greater.

 Moreover, some Web servers need to be properly configured so that the linked
 assets are accessible to Web users. For example, for Apache Web server, the
 following configuration directive should be added for the Web folder:

   Options FollowSymLinks



$fileMode				*yii/web/AssetManager::$fileMode*
 (integer) The permission to be set for newly published asset files. This
 value will be used by PHP chmod() function. No umask will be applied. If not
 set, the permission will be determined by the current environment.

$dirMode				*yii/web/AssetManager::$dirMode*
 (integer) The permission to be set for newly generated asset directories.
 This value will be used by PHP chmod() function. No umask will be applied.
 Defaults to 0775, meaning the directory is read-writable by owner and group,
 but read-only for other users.

$behaviors				*yii/web/AssetManager::$behaviors*
 (\yii\base\Behavior[]) List of behaviors attached to this component

$converter				*yii/web/AssetManager::$converter*
 (\yii\web\AssetConverterInterface) The asset converter.

*yii/web/AssetManager::getBundle*				public
>
 getBundle($name, $publish='true')
<
(\yii\web\AssetBundle) The asset bundle instance

 This method will first look for the bundle in 'bundles'. If not found, it
 will treat '$name' as the class of the asset bundle and create a new instance
 of it.
    [$name] (string) The class name of the asset bundle
    [$publish] (boolean) Whether to publish the asset files in the asset
    bundle before it is returned. If you set this false, you must manually
    call 'AssetBundle::publish()' to publish the asset files.


*yii/web/AssetManager::getConverter*			public
>
 getConverter()
<
(\yii\web\AssetConverterInterface) The asset converter.



*yii/web/AssetManager::setConverter*			public
>
 setConverter($value)
<
(void)

    [$value] (array|\yii\web\AssetConverterInterface) The asset converter.
    This can be either an object implementing the 'AssetConverterInterface',
    or a configuration array that can be used to create the asset converter
    object.


*yii/web/AssetManager::publish*				public
>
 publish($path, $options='[]')
<
(array) The path (directory or file path) and the URL that the asset is
published as.

 This method will copy the specified file or directory to 'basePath' so that
 it can be accessed via the Web server.

 If the asset is a file, its file modification time will be checked to avoid
 unnecessary file copying.

 If the asset is a directory, all files and subdirectories under it will be
 published recursively. Note, in case $forceCopy is false the method only
 checks the existence of the target directory to avoid repetitive copying
 (which is very expensive).

 By default, when publishing a directory, subdirectories and files whose name
 starts with a dot "." will NOT be published. If you want to change this
 behavior, you may specify the "beforeCopy" option as explained in the
 '$options' parameter.

 Note: On rare scenario, a race condition can develop that will lead to a
 one-time-manifestation of a non-critical problem in the creation of the
 directory that holds the published assets. This problem can be avoided
 altogether by 'requesting' in advance all the resources that are supposed to
 trigger a 'publish()' call, and doing that in the application deployment
 phase, before system goes live. See more in the following discussion:
 http://code.google.com/p/yii/issues/detail?id=2579
    [$path] (string) The asset (file or directory) to be published
    [$options] (array) The options to be applied when publishing a directory.
    The following options are supported:


      - beforeCopy: callback, a PHP callback that is called before copying
      each sub-directory or file.   This option is used only when publishing a
    directory. If the callback returns false, the copy   operation for the
    sub-directory or file will be cancelled.   The signature of the callback
    should be: 'function ($from, $to)', where '$from' is the sub-directory or 
     file to be copied from, while '$to' is the copy target. 
      - afterCopy: callback, a PHP callback that is called after a
      sub-directory or file is successfully copied.   This option is used only
    when publishing a directory. The signature of the callback is similar to
    that   of 'beforeCopy'. 
      - forceCopy: boolean, whether the directory being published should
      be copied even if   it is found in the target directory. This option is
    used only when publishing a directory.   You may want to set this to be
    true during the development stage to make sure the published   directory
    is always up-to-date. Do not set this to true on production servers as it
    will   significantly degrade the performance.


*yii/web/AssetManager::getPublishedPath*			public
>
 getPublishedPath($path)
<
(string) The published file path. False if the file or directory does not
exist

 This method does not perform any publishing. It merely tells you if the file
 or directory is published, where it will go.
    [$path] (string) Directory or file path being published


*yii/web/AssetManager::getPublishedUrl*			public
>
 getPublishedUrl($path)
<
(string) The published URL for the file or directory. False if the file or
directory does not exist.

 This method does not perform any publishing. It merely tells you if the file
 path is published, what the URL will be to access it.
    [$path] (string) Directory or file path being published


*yii/web/AssetManager::hash*				protected
>
 hash($path)
<
(string) Hashed string.

    [$path] (string) String to be hashed.
