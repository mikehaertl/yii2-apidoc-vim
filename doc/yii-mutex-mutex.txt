DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This is achieved by using a "lock" mechanism. Each possibly concurrent thread
 cooperates by acquiring a lock before accessing the corresponding data.

 Usage example:

 ''' if ($mutex->acquire($mutexName)) {     // business logic execution } else
 {     // execution is blocked! } '''

 This is a base class, which should be extended in order to implement the
 actual lock mechanism.


PROPERTY DETAILS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$autoRelease				*yii/mutex/Mutex::$autoRelease*

 (bool) Whether all locks acquired in this process (i.e. local locks) must be
 released automatically before finishing script execution. Defaults to true.
 Setting this property to true means that all locks acquired in this process
 must be released (regardless of errors or exceptions).

*yii/mutex/Mutex::acquire*				public
>
 acquire($name, $timeout=0)
<
return (bool) Lock acquiring result.

 Acquires a lock by name.

    [$name] (string) Of the lock to be acquired. Must be unique.
    [$timeout] (int) Time (in seconds) to wait for lock to be released.
    Defaults to zero meaning that method will return false immediately in case
    lock was already acquired.


*yii/mutex/Mutex::release*				public
>
 release($name)
<
return (bool) Lock release result: false in case named lock was not found..

 Releases acquired lock. This method will return false in case the lock was
 not found.

    [$name] (string) Of the lock to be released. This lock must already exist.


*yii/mutex/Mutex::acquireLock*				protected
>
 acquireLock($name, $timeout=0)
<
return (bool) Acquiring result.

 This method should be extended by a concrete Mutex implementations. Acquires
 lock by name.

    [$name] (string) Of the lock to be acquired.
    [$timeout] (int) Time (in seconds) to wait for the lock to be released.


*yii/mutex/Mutex::releaseLock*				protected
>
 releaseLock($name)
<
return (bool) Release result.

 This method should be extended by a concrete Mutex implementations. Releases
 lock by given name.

    [$name] (string) Of the lock to be released.
