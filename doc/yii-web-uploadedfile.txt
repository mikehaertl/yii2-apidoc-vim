*yii/web/UploadedFile*   >> |yii/base/Object|
======================

DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 You can call 'getInstance()' to retrieve the instance of an uploaded file,
 and then use 'saveAs()' to save it on the server. You may also query other
 information about the file, including 'name', 'tempName', 'type', 'size' and
 'error'.


PROPERTY DETAILS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$name					*yii/web/UploadedFile::$name*
 (string) The original name of the file being uploaded

$tempName				*yii/web/UploadedFile::$tempName*
 (string) The path of the uploaded file on the server. Note, this is a
 temporary file which will be automatically deleted by PHP after the current
 request is processed.

$type					*yii/web/UploadedFile::$type*
 (string) The MIME-type of the uploaded file (such as "image/gif"). Since this
 MIME type is not checked on the server side, do not take this value for
 granted. Instead, use '\yii\helpers\FileHelper::getMimeType()' to determine
 the exact MIME type.

$size					*yii/web/UploadedFile::$size*
 (integer) The actual size of the uploaded file in bytes

$error					*yii/web/UploadedFile::$error*
 (integer) An error code describing the status of this file uploading.

$baseName				*yii/web/UploadedFile::$baseName*
 (string) Original file base name

$extension				*yii/web/UploadedFile::$extension*
 (string) File extension

$hasError				*yii/web/UploadedFile::$hasError*
 (boolean) Whether there is an error with the uploaded file. Check 'error' for
 detailed error code information.

*yii/web/UploadedFile::__toString*			public

 __toString()
<

*yii/web/UploadedFile::getInstance*			public
>
 getInstance($model, $attribute)
<
(\yii\web\UploadedFile) The instance of the uploaded file. Null is returned if
no file is uploaded for the specified model attribute.

 The file should be uploaded using '\yii\widgets\ActiveField::fileInput()'.
    [$model] (\yii\base\Model) The data model
    [$attribute] (string) The attribute name. The attribute name may contain
    array indexes. For example, '[1]file' for tabular file uploading; and
    'file[1]' for an element in a file array.


*yii/web/UploadedFile::getInstances*			public
>
 getInstances($model, $attribute)
<
(\yii\web\UploadedFile[]) Array of UploadedFile objects. Empty array is
returned if no available file was found for the given attribute.

    [$model] (\yii\base\Model) The data model
    [$attribute] (string) The attribute name. The attribute name may contain
    array indexes for tabular file uploading, e.g. '[1]file'.

(\yii\web\UploadedFile[]) The array of UploadedFile objects. Empty array is
returned if no adequate upload was found. Please note that this array will
contain all files from all sub-arrays regardless how deeply nested they are.

 This is mainly used when multiple files were uploaded and saved as
 'files[0]', 'files[1]', 'files[n]'..., and you can retrieve them all by
 passing 'files' as the name.
    [$name] (string) The name of the array of files


*yii/web/UploadedFile::reset*				public
>

 Note that this method uses php's move_uploaded_file() method. If the target
 file '$file' already exists, it will be overwritten.
    [$file] (string) The file path used to save the uploaded file
    [$deleteTempFile] (boolean) Whether to delete the temporary file after
    saving. If true, you will not be able to save the uploaded file again in
