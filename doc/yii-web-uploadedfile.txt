*yii/web/UploadedFile*   >> |yii/base/BaseObject|
======================

DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 You can call 'getInstance()' to retrieve the instance of an uploaded file,
 and then use 'saveAs()' to save it on the server. You may also query other
 information about the file, including 'name', 'tempName', 'type', 'size' and
 'error'.

 For more details and usage information on UploadedFile, see the [guide
 article on handling uploads](guide:input-file-upload).


PROPERTY DETAILS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$name					*yii/web/UploadedFile::$name*

 (string) The original name of the file being uploaded

$tempName				*yii/web/UploadedFile::$tempName*

 (string) The path of the uploaded file on the server. Note, this is a
 temporary file which will be automatically deleted by PHP after the current
 request is processed.

$type					*yii/web/UploadedFile::$type*

 (string) The MIME-type of the uploaded file (such as "image/gif"). Since this
 MIME type is not checked on the server-side, do not take this value for
 granted. Instead, use '\yii\helpers\FileHelper::getMimeType()' to determine
 the exact MIME type.

$size					*yii/web/UploadedFile::$size*

 (int) The actual size of the uploaded file in bytes

$error					*yii/web/UploadedFile::$error*

 (int) An error code describing the status of this file uploading.

*yii/web/UploadedFile::__toString*			public
>
 __toString()
<
return (string) The string representation of the object

 This is PHP magic method that returns string representation of an object. The
 implementation here returns the uploaded file's name.


*yii/web/UploadedFile::getInstance*			public
>
 getInstance($model, $attribute)
<
return (\yii\web\UploadedFile) The instance of the uploaded file. Null is returned if
no file is uploaded for the specified model attribute.

 The file should be uploaded using '\yii\widgets\ActiveField::fileInput()'.

    [$model] (\yii\base\Model) The data model
    [$attribute] (string) The attribute name. The attribute name may contain
    array indexes. For example, '[1]file' for tabular file uploading; and
    'file[1]' for an element in a file array.


*yii/web/UploadedFile::getInstances*			public
>
 getInstances($model, $attribute)
<
return (\yii\web\UploadedFile[]) Array of UploadedFile objects. Empty array is
returned if no available file was found for the given attribute.

    [$model] (\yii\base\Model) The data model
    [$attribute] (string) The attribute name. The attribute name may contain
    array indexes for tabular file uploading, e.g. '[1]file'.


*yii/web/UploadedFile::getInstanceByName*			public
>
 getInstanceByName($name)
<
return (null|\yii\web\UploadedFile) The instance of the uploaded file. Null is
returned if no file is uploaded for the specified name.

 The name can be a plain string or a string like an array element (e.g.
 'Post[imageFile]', or 'Post[0][imageFile]').

    [$name] (string) The name of the file input field.


*yii/web/UploadedFile::getInstancesByName*		public
>
 getInstancesByName($name)
<
return (\yii\web\UploadedFile[]) The array of UploadedFile objects. Empty array is
returned if no adequate upload was found. Please note that this array will
contain all files from all sub-arrays regardless how deeply nested they are.

 This is mainly used when multiple files were uploaded and saved as
 'files[0]', 'files[1]', 'files[n]'..., and you can retrieve them all by
 passing 'files' as the name.

    [$name] (string) The name of the array of files


*yii/web/UploadedFile::reset*				public
>
 reset()
<
return (void)

 This method is mainly used by test scripts to set up a fixture.


*yii/web/UploadedFile::saveAs*				public
>
 saveAs($file, $deleteTempFile='true')
<
return (bool) True whether the file is saved successfully

 Note that this method uses php's move_uploaded_file() method. If the target
 file '$file' already exists, it will be overwritten.

    [$file] (string) The file path used to save the uploaded file
    [$deleteTempFile] (bool) Whether to delete the temporary file after
    saving. If true, you will not be able to save the uploaded file again in
    the current request.


*yii/web/UploadedFile::getBaseName*			public
>
 getBaseName()
<
return (string) Original file base name



*yii/web/UploadedFile::getExtension*			public
