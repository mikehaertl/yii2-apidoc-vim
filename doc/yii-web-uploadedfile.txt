*yii/web/UploadedFile*   >> |yii/base/BaseObject|
======================

DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 You can call 'getInstance()' to retrieve the instance of an uploaded file,
 and then use 'saveAs()' to save it on the server. You may also query other
 information about the file, including 'name', 'tempName', 'type', 'size' and
 'error'.

 For more details and usage information on UploadedFile, see the [guide
 article on handling uploads](guide:input-file-upload).


PROPERTY DETAILS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


$name					*yii/web/UploadedFile::$name*

 (string) The original name of the file being uploaded

$tempName				*yii/web/UploadedFile::$tempName*

 (string) The path of the uploaded file on the server. Note, this is a
 temporary file which will be automatically deleted by PHP after the current
 request is processed.

$type					*yii/web/UploadedFile::$type*

 (string) The MIME-type of the uploaded file (such as "image/gif"). Since this
 MIME type is not checked on the server-side, do not take this value for
 granted. Instead, use '\yii\helpers\FileHelper::getMimeType()' to determine
 the exact MIME type.

$size					*yii/web/UploadedFile::$size*

 (int) The actual size of the uploaded file in bytes

$error					*yii/web/UploadedFile::$error*

 (int) An error code describing the status of this file uploading.

    array indexes. For example, '[1]file' for tabular file uploading; and
    'file[1]' for an element in a file array.


*yii/web/UploadedFile::getInstances*			public
>
 getInstances($model, $attribute)
<
return (\yii\web\UploadedFile[]) Array of UploadedFile objects. Empty array is
returned if no available file was found for the given attribute.

 Returns all uploaded files for the given model attribute.

    [$model] (\yii\base\Model) The data model
