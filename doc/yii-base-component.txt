DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Component provides the *event* and *behavior* features, in addition to the
 *property* feature which is implemented in its parent class 'Object'.

 Event is a way to "inject" custom code into existing code at certain places.
 For example, a comment object can trigger an "add" event when the user adds a
 comment. We can write custom code and attach it to this event so that when
 the event is triggered (i.e. comment will be added), our custom code will be
 executed.

 An event is identified by a name that should be unique within the class it is
 defined at. Event names are *case-sensitive*.

 One or multiple PHP callbacks, called *event handlers*, can be attached to an
 event. You can call 'trigger()' to raise an event. When an event is raised,
 the event handlers will be invoked automatically in the order they were
 attached.

 To attach an event handler to an event, call 'on()':

   $post->on('update', function ($event) {
       // send email notification
   });

 In the above, an anonymous function is attached to the "update" event of the
 post. You may attach the following types of event handlers:

 - anonymous function: 'function ($event) { ... }' - object method: '[$object,
 'handleAdd']' - static class method: '['Page', 'handleAdd']' - global
 function: ''handleAdd''

 The signature of an event handler should be like the following:

   function foo($event)

 where '$event' is an 'Event' object which includes parameters associated with
 the event.

 You can also attach a handler to an event when configuring a component with a
 configuration array. The syntax is like the following:

   [
       'on add' => function ($event) { ... }
   ]

 where 'on add' stands for attaching an event to the 'add' event.

 Sometimes, you may want to associate extra data with an event handler when
 you attach it to an event and then access it when the handler is invoked. You
 may do so by

   $post->on('update', function ($event) {
       // the data can be accessed via $event->data
   }, $data);

 A behavior is an instance of 'Behavior' or its child class. A component can
 be attached with one or multiple behaviors. When a behavior is attached to a
 component, its public properties and methods can be accessed via the
 component directly, as if the component owns those properties and methods.

 To attach a behavior to a component, declare it in 'behaviors()', or
 explicitly call 'attachBehavior'. Behaviors declared in 'behaviors()' are
 automatically attached to the corresponding component.

 One can also attach a behavior to a component when configuring it with a
 configuration array. The syntax is like the following:

   [
       'as tree' => [
           'class' => 'Tree',
       ],
   ]

 where 'as tree' stands for attaching a behavior named 'tree', and the array
 will be passed to '\Yii::createObject()' to create the behavior object.

*yii/base/Component::hasProperty*				public
>
 hasProperty($name, $checkVars='true', $checkBehaviors='true')
<
(boolean) Whether the property is defined

 A property is defined if:

 - the class has a getter or setter method associated with the specified name 
  (in this case, property name is case-insensitive); - the class has a member
 variable with the specified name (when '$checkVars' is true); - an attached
 behavior has a property of the given name (when '$checkBehaviors' is true).
    [$name] (string) The property name

    [$checkVars] (boolean) Whether to treat member variables as properties
    [$checkBehaviors] (boolean) Whether to treat behaviors' properties as
    properties of this component


*yii/base/Component::hasMethod*				public
>
 hasMethod($name, $checkBehaviors='true')
<
(boolean) Whether the property is defined

 A method is defined if:

 - the class has a method with the specified name - an attached behavior has a
 method with the given name (when '$checkBehaviors' is true).
    [$name] (string) The property name
    [$checkBehaviors] (boolean) Whether to treat behaviors' methods as methods
    of this component


*yii/base/Component::__clone*				public
>
 __clone()
<
(void)

 It removes all behaviors because they are attached to the old object.


*yii/base/Component::behaviors*				public
>
 behaviors()
<
(array) The behavior configurations.

 Child classes may override this method to specify the behaviors they want to
 behave as.

 The return value of this method should be an array of behavior objects or
 configurations indexed by behavior names. A behavior configuration can be
 either a string specifying the behavior class or an array of the following
 structure:

   'behaviorName' => [
       'class' => 'BehaviorClass',
       'property1' => 'value1',
       'property2' => 'value2',
   ]

 Note that a behavior class must extend from 'Behavior'. Behavior names can be
 strings or integers. If the former, they uniquely identify the behaviors. If
 the latter, the corresponding behaviors are anonymous and their properties
 and methods will NOT be made available via the component (however, the
 behaviors can still respond to the component's events).

 Behaviors declared in this method will be attached to the component
 automatically (on demand).


*yii/base/Component::hasEventHandlers*			public
>
 hasEventHandlers($name)
<
(boolean) Whether there is any handler attached to the event.


    [$name] (string) The event name


*yii/base/Component::on*					public
>
 on($name, $handler, $data='null')
<
(void)

 The event handler must be a valid PHP callback. The followings are some
 examples:

   function ($event) { ... }         // anonymous function
   [$object, 'handleClick']          // $object->handleClick()
   ['Page', 'handleClick']           // Page::handleClick()
   'handleClick'                     // global function handleClick()

 The event handler must be defined with the following signature,

   function ($event)

 where '$event' is an 'Event' object which includes parameters associated with
 the event.
    [$name] (string) The event name
    [$handler] (callable) The event handler
    [$data] (mixed) The data to be passed to the event handler when the event
    is triggered. When the event handler is invoked, this data can be accessed
    via 'Event::data'.


*yii/base/Component::off*					public
>
 off($name, $handler='null')
<
(boolean) If a handler is found and detached

 This method is the opposite of 'on()'.
    [$name] (string) Event name
    [$handler] (callable) The event handler to be removed. If it is null, all
    handlers attached to the named event will be removed.


*yii/base/Component::trigger*				public
>
 trigger($name, $event='null')
<
(void)

 This method represents the happening of an event. It invokes all attached
 handlers for the event including class-level handlers.
    [$name] (string) The event name
    [$event] (\yii\base\Event) The event parameter. If not set, a default
    'Event' object will be created.


*yii/base/Component::getBehavior*				public
>
 getBehavior($name)
<
(\yii\base\Behavior) The behavior object, or null if the behavior does not
exist


    [$name] (string) The behavior name


*yii/base/Component::getBehaviors*			public
>
 getBehaviors()
<
(\yii\base\Behavior[]) List of behaviors attached to this component




*yii/base/Component::attachBehavior*			public
>
 attachBehavior($name, $behavior)
<
(\yii\base\Behavior) The behavior object

 This method will create the behavior object based on the given configuration.
 After that, the behavior object will be attached to this component by calling
 the 'Behavior::attach()' method.
    [$name] (string) The name of the behavior.
    [$behavior] (string|array|\yii\base\Behavior) The behavior configuration.
    This can be one of the following:

     - a 'Behavior' object  - a string specifying the behavior class  - an
    object configuration array that will be passed to 'Yii::createObject()' to
    create the behavior object.


*yii/base/Component::attachBehaviors*			public
>
 attachBehaviors($behaviors)
<
(void)

 Each behavior is indexed by its name and should be a 'Behavior' object, a
 string specifying the behavior class, or an configuration array for creating
 the behavior.
    [$behaviors] (array) List of behaviors to be attached to the component


*yii/base/Component::detachBehavior*			public
>
 detachBehavior($name)
<
(\yii\base\Behavior) The detached behavior. Null if the behavior does not
exist.

 The behavior's 'Behavior::detach()' method will be invoked.
    [$name] (string) The behavior's name.


*yii/base/Component::detachBehaviors*			public
>
